                        <p>
                            I hope you find this post because there is no way of me saying all this to your face.<br><br>
                            For as long as I know you, I constantly walk on eggshells around you because anything I do or say could upset you at any moment. 
                            You might say it didn't bother you at the time, but based on your action, it looked like it. I am not saying I am any better than you. I am emotionally unstable too, but I manage it and I 
                            don't blame it on anyone. 
                            It is obvious that you have a crush on S, because ever since I know you, you always take photos of S, always act close to him, 
                            and at the start of your friendship, you were calling him your best friend, but he didn't acknowledge that.<br><br>
                            You haven't said a word to me for a week now, and at the point, I am too tired to care. 
                            I am always the one reaching out first, I am always the one to say good morning to you, 
                            I am always the one making plans for us.                            
                            I stopped talking to you to see how long it would take you to talk to me, and the last time you spoke to me was yesterday, which is what this post is about. <br><br>
                            <h2 class="section-heading">Yesterday</h2>
                            At 6:49 PM, you sent a big message to the group chat saying that you felt that there is a rift between this group of friends, you specifically said that you felt
                            this group of friends has divided into preferences between people. <br><br>

                            I think it's funny that you don't tell me your problems but then you blasted in the group chat 
                            about how we (D, S and I) are the problems. 
                            When I asked what made you said that, you said "It's obvious to me that S and D have built a closer friendship
                            , so in our group chat it would sometimes be them having their own entire conversation in the chat, with inside jokes and what not.
                            ...
                            But I've felt a split between D, S and Tiff then H, T and myself. ...
                            So there's that gap in the frienship circle... It's nothing personal, just this friendship circle doesn't feel right to me" <br> <br> 
                            First of all, you said it's nothing personal, but you sounded offended and butthurt by this friendship between them 2. Who are you to 
                            say this friendship of theirs isn't right? Who says that in a group of friends, you need to be close friend with everyone?
                            I am his gf, and I don't even mind they have their own convo, who are you to say?<br> <br> 
                            S and D have so much in common you would never imagine. That's why they click. D tried to bond with your bf but your bf is too 
                            lazy to do anything and to self-absorbed to admit he is not the best in the world. D tried to get your bf jobs at SAP, your bf flat out refused to apply. We planned the Japan trip together, you decided not to go.
                            We asked you to go VN, you and your bf said no because he is too well-known here, he was scared he would get kidnap in VN. Like bruh, do you hear yourself?  <br><br>

                            Second of all, why the fuck do you drag my name into this? The last time I interacted with  you was last Friday, where I sent you 
                            the tiktoks, and all you did was reacted to them. You didn't talk to me first, you never did. But to say that there's a split 
                            between me and you 3 is just ignorant. We (me, D, T) asked everyone to play basketball on Sunday, you and your bf both said no,
                            he even said he doesn't like playing on sunday because he wants to do something else with you. That is fine. Even S is not playing on Sunday with us, 
                            do you see him complaining about not being in the team with us?<br><br>
                            Another point for you, on the 19/4, you sent a message in the group chat with me, you, D and your bf, asking me and D if 
                            we wanted to go camping with you on 28th-30th "...T, T's wife, T's Brother, H and I. S will be too tired to join us". I'm 
                            sorry but did you have a conversation with the group without me and D to discuss camping and you just realised you needed to include us?
                            It looks to me that you all had a chat among eachother, and agreed on the date without us, and do you see me or D making a big fuss about it?
                            No. Because we are all adults here, we act like adults. We don't throw tantrum when things don't go our ways.
                            But don't fucking say we have rift because of me, S and D.
                            <br> <br> 
                            Third of all, it is ok for you and your boyfriend to be close to me and D, but it is not ok for S to be close to us?
                            What about T and his wife? If they don't complain, who are you to complain? Don't you think it's hypocritical of you to say shit like that?
                            It makes you look like you have mental health issues btw.
                            Or are you just jealous because S is getting closer to me? Because you have a crush on him? <br><br>
                            Let me tell you something that's going to break your heart. I do know that S respected me and D more than he does for you and your bf. 100% guarantee. 
                            Me and D have high paying jobs. We have properties. We have money saved up. We are solid. He likes to hang out with people who are better than him, is that wrong?
                            I know that he even wanted to move in with us if we do decide to move to the city. Does that kill you now?
                            Or did you know T and his wife wanted to go out eat with us after basketball and T really wants his wife to hang out with me and D? Are you fainting yet?
                            
                            <br> <br>
                            S asked you, your bf and T multiple times in the group chat to do the seance thing, and you all just ignored him. You responded in the group chat saying that you wanted to go camping and
                            for us to go ahead without you. Then the week before seance, you happily said in the group chat camping got cancelled so now you wanted to go. S made the mistake of saying that R and his gf were 
                            coming, and you passive aggressively said that we replaced you. AND OFF YOU WENT. No message, no talking to anyone. 
                            I do think this is the reason why you thought that me, S and D broke up the group. But let me tell you one thing, we asked T and he said no too.
                            
                            <br> <br> 
                            You kept saying it wasn't because of the seance thing, but you didn't give any other explanation as to why you thought there was a distance between the people in the group. 
                            I asked you and all you gave me were word salads. "I don't know exactly when it happened. It just happened over time because I feel the distance. It came from observation and how I feel."
                            Bruh if you look through all the text message and group chats, it didn't look like there was distance between us at all. The banters in the group exists even on the night you sent the message.
                            You are so entitled to your own opinion and feelings that you keep blaming other people for the way you feel, for your emotions and your actions. You do so because you believe that if you paint yourself as a victim, 
                            eventually someone will come along and save you and you'll receive all the love you've always wanted. In case you haven't realised, me, S, D and T are too nice to bring all these up to you because we are worried you 
                            might hurt yourself. But we are not joining your pity party. You need to start taking responsibility for your life. Struggling with anxiet? Go see a therapist. Want to hang out with people? Reach out to them. 
                            I expect my friends to invest the same amount of effort that I do into our relationships. There's a difference between "never reaches out" and "doesn't reach out often," 
                            so I don't really mind if a friend doesn't initiate conversation super often, but there has to be at least some effort. If you check our private DM, 
                            you will see that I'm always the one initiating the convo, and never you.
                            <br> <br> 
                            You said 
                            <br> <br> 
                            I do think you have all these scenarios in your head that portrays us as villians and you and your bf are the perfect victims.
                            
                            You want to keep that image of you having a perfect life and perfect boyfriend. 
                            You constantly post photos of your life and your relationship all the time, saying shit like the love of your life and cringey shit like that on social media, 
                            but in reality, your life is a mess. 
                            You're stuck in a dead end job, being an admin, even though you has a bachelor degree. 
                            Your salary isn’t high either, I guarantee max at 70k. <br><br>
                            The problem with you is, you live a life surrounded by yes man and woman, so things come easy for you when you were growing up. 
                            It doesn’t work like that anymore if you don’t try your hardest, you will get stuck in life. 
                            
                            <br><br>
                            <h2 class="section-heading">Final say</h2>
                            Anyway, I just want to say, you have high expectation of your life and your love life, but wouldn’t do anything about them to improve. 
                            And when things don’t go your way, you crashed and became withdrawn and depressed, but that’s not how you live your life.
                            And just so you know, I ain't reaching out first anymore. I am done being the second choice. If you value me as your friend, then reach out. Because I've done my part,
                            you can keep your depression to yourself for all I care.
                        </p>
