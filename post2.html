                        <p>
                            My Mum passed away when I was an infant, so I do not have any memory of her sadly. I grew up without a mother figure and having a step mother who constantly
                            berated and beat me up daily, it took a toll on me. I am a grown woman who does not know how to communicate with other women. I am a 
                            grown woman who does not know how to accept compliments. 
                            No one was there to teach me about gender norms, societal expectations, and nurturing behaviors.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Dad, I missed you. 
                            Sometimes I lay at night crying because I released I cannot see or talk to you anymore. You were not the best father in the world, but you tried. I know you tried.
                            You didn't abuse me or anything when you were sober, even when you were drunk, you didn't lay a hand on me. However, you did yelled at me every time you were drunk, 
                            but that's ok to me.
                        </p>

                        <p> 
                            I think you were still chasing you dream when you had me and my brother, you didn't know what to do in life. As an adult, I understand it. You wanted money, 
                            women, fame and no responsibilities. Everyone does. But I am grateful that you still tried, that you got a job and supported your family, that you raised me.
                        </p>

                            <p>
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">I missed you Dad</h2>

                            <p>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, I do thank my mum for the experience of growing up without a mother as it cultivated the resilience, independence, and self-reliance in me. 
                                    I moved out at 17, no help from anyone, started saving on my own, even went by days without food. 

                            </p>
                        <p>
                            I want you to know that despite the pain of your absence, I am finding my way in this world. I have been surrounded by a loving support network, friends who have become like family, and mentors who have stepped in to offer guidance when I needed it most. They have reminded me of the values you instilled in me, and I am forever grateful for their presence in my life.
                        </p>
                        <p>So thank you.</p>
