                            <h2 class="section-heading">1) How did my day go?</h2>
                            YOU, MH, you ruined my day  <br><br>
                            My day started out fun with Big Dave, my David, Rodney in the car. We were bonding and I was happy. We got to the site, you were
                            chummy with Lena, jumping up and down all happy, then you saw us, you stopped and sulk. We started walking to the site and you didn't say a single 
                            word to me so I started talking to you first (as usual). I asked you about your ankles and I even happily said you should join our team next season, even your
                            bf was happy to say yeah let's play next season. And that was the last thing we talked about. I waited all hike to see if you would talk to me first, 
                            but you wouldn't. You were happy to talk to Lena though, but not me. 
                            Then you started talking to Big Dave about his sister and her husband, all chummy with Big Dave, saying how you knew his sister. 
                            You were happy to be chummy with new people in the group, but you completely ignored your close friends. <br><br>
                            Do you remember walking past me to get in the middle of a photo that Sam was taking of us? I do, because I was gesturing you to come next to me and 
                            you decided to walk past me and stood in front of Rodney and Harry instead of standing next to me.
                            And yes, this was captured on camera by Sam too.<br><br>
                            Do you remember avoiding eye contact with me and abruptly left after we ate? You and your bf, out of nowhere, said that you were heading off now
                            because you have some family thing tonight. You then just started walking off without saying much and your bf went after you hurriedly,
                            we thought it was so weird and rude that you did that, yes, even Rodney and Big Dave thought so.<br><br>
                            Apart from that, the hike was good. My legs were shaking anytime I stopped, and I thought I had a good exercise. 
                            <h2 class="section-heading">2) What did I learn today?</h2>
                            You, MH:<br><br>
                            I learned that I am very tired of being the bad guy in this friendship to make you happy. <br><br>
                            I learned that I am not a bad person, and everyone around me tells me so but I feel that you are making me a bad person because of the way I am reacting to you. <br><br>
                            I learned that you keep giving me false hope and empty promises, e.g. you agreed to let me know if you are ever in a bad mood, you would tell 
                            me and I would give you space. You never tell me anything. We agreed to be honest with one another, yet you don't tell me anything and constantly ignoring me.<br><br>
                            I learned that you would rather have a deep conversation with new people in the group about your life than tell me anything, e.g. you told Big Dave about how you 
                            felt that breaking your ankles, and how it put you in a weird state of mind. Yet you never mentioned anything to me. 
                            
                            <h2 class="section-heading">3) What do I plan to do?</h2>
                            I will play your game. You ignore me, I will ignore you, it's a 2 way street and I ain't afraid of fading you 
                            out of my life.  <br>
                            <br>
                            I cried a lot for you, when I should'nt have. Now I gave up on you when you always had plans with the other person 
                            and was never the one to reach out to me first. 
                            It was sad and I still miss spending time with you, but I have new friends who actually want to be friends back.
                             I don't think friendships should ever be forced. I will fade myself out of your life. 
                             If you want to replace me, it's because you don't want me as a friend anymore. 
                             I'd rather leave first than find my company is no longer welcome. 
                             Nobody gets my good friend privileges without making time for me as an individual for the benefit of simply my company.
                            I cannot trust you anymore. You constantly hurt my feeling with your actions and I am so tired of it. <br><br>
                            Do I feel bitter about it? Yes. Can I do anything about it? Not really. Sometimes you just have to accept you can't "make" someone like you and want to spend time with you, and I think that is a sign that the relationship isn't what it used to be.

                            <h2 class="section-heading">                            </h2>
                            
                            <br><br>
                            <h2 class="section-heading">Final say</h2>
                            I will distance myself from you moving forward. I have already muted the group chat we had, and tbh with you, I will not 
                            sign up to any basketball team with you, mainly because I cannot trust you anymore. 
                        </p>


                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>So thank you.</p>
