                        <p>
                            I know you will never find this post and even if you do find this post, I know for a fact that you believe you did nothing wrong raising me. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ever since my dad started living with you, 
                            my life became a nightmare because of you.
                            You seemed to take pleasure in making my life miserable, berating me at every turn and lashing out with physical violence whenever you deemed it necessary.
                            You seemed to have free reign over my life, controlling every aspect of my existence and punishing me mercilessly whenever I failed to meet your impossibly high standards.
                            And so I lived in a constant state of fear and anxiety, never knowing when you would strike next, and always feeling like I was walking on eggshells around you.

                        </p>

                        <p> 
                            When I was around 5 years old, with my dad working long hours to make ends meet, and because you often left for work after him, 
                            instead of telling my older brother to look after me,  or perhaps you could have sent me to day care or pre school, 
                            you would lock me alone in our small studio apartment, with nothing but my thoughts and my fear to keep me company. 
                            As the days turned into weeks, I began to withdraw from the world around me, becoming more and more isolated. This went on for 2 years until you decided I was old enough for school,
                            so you enrolled me in primary school, 1 year later than everyone my age, but it didn't seem to bother you at all. 
                            Keep in mind that because of how poor we were, you never had to pay for my school fee.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Repeated childhood trauma causes a child to live in a constant state of hypervigilance, always alert to impending perceived danger. â€“ Unknown                        </blockquote>

                            <p>
                            Did you ever wonder why I never had any friends in primary school? For as long as I can remember, I struggled to make friends, 
                            spending most of my time alone and avoiding eye contact with anyone who passed me by. 
                            And as the years went on, my anxiety only grew worse, until even the thought of leaving my house filled me with a sense of overwhelming dread, 
                            where I faked being sick and dad was extremely worried about me.
                            That moment forever stuck in my head, when he was getting ready for work in the early morning, you were still sleeping, I told him I was feeling cold, he touched my forhead to check my temperature, but didn't say anything.
                            When he left, he told me he would get me some medicines on his way home. I think he knew I was faking it.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After I started year 1, you forced me to work after school. For years, I had to help you sell lottery tickets on the streets to earn money and tried
                             to sell out the tickets as quickly as possible before returning home to cook food for you and my dad. I remember boiling the water for soup, I remember looking at the pot, I don't know why, but I just stared at it.
                             The image of the pot is still in my head till this day.
                            I am not complaining about working at a young age, I know we were poor and we needed money, but what I am about to share, I am blaming you on every aspect.

                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The final straw</h2>

                            <p>
                                Did you know that your youngest son from your first marriage sexually assaulted me? Did you know your landlord, whose apartment you and dad were renting from inappropriately grabbed my breasts twice?
                                I went to his store to try and sell him some lottery tickets and twice, he grabbed my breasts. The first time it happened, I thought maybe it was a mistake, but after he did it against the second time, I never came back to his store.
                                I rather walked further to other people who would buy from me without touching me. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Your youngest son was the worst. On this day, I was sleeping, I'm not sure what time of the day it was, but I woke up to him on top of me with my pants down, I do not remember what happened during or after 
                                    that but as you can tell, I did not want to remember this moment. The attack left me feeling violated, ashamed, and alone, and I struggled to come to terms with what had happened.

                                    I was too young to understand, too young to realise what they did were wrong, so I buried my feelings and thoughts. But now that I am older, bury the feelings is not an option because
                                     the trauma of the assault lingered, and now I found myself struggling with anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Untill this day, I still back away when my partner touches my chest, and we have been together
                                     13 years. 
                                                                
                                Did you know any of that? I bet you didn't because I never told you, I never told anyone except my partner, even if I did tell you back then, I can guarantee that you would not believe me.
                            </p>
                        <p>
                            Do you remember hitting me when I refused to eat plain rice with sugar with all the neighbours around? I remember that. Because that was the first time I told myself not to cry in front of you
                            to give you any satisfaction. After all the beatings, I finally realised that if I cried, I lost to you, so I didn't cry, because I wanted to see how mad you would get seeing me not crying. 
                            And you fell for it. You got mad. Real mad, and you grabbed the broomstick and beat the shit out of me. I cannot remember now whether I cried at the end of not, or maybe I passed out from the
                            pain, but my mind is blank here. But this is to show you that, you ruined my childhood, and you made me a resentful person.
                        </p>
                        <p>So thank you.</p>
